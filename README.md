# Hello Worlds
 
Creating hello world in a different programming language... everyday... for all of eternity.

## Resources

Before we get started, special thanks to the following:

- http://rosettacode.org/
- https://esolangs.org/
- http://stackoverflow.com/

## Dear God, Why?

Because learning. S'why.

## Contributing

Want to contribute to our little project? Take a look at some of our existing
examples, take a crack at any language, and submit a pull request.

We are by no means experts, so if you see something that can be improved upon,
please let us know (or submit a pull request with the changes yourself)!

### Structure

All new submissions should be placed in a subfolder matching the extension for the
language (i.e. `cpp` for C++, `py` for Python, etc).

### Functionality

We haven't exactly established many rules, but here are some guidelines that we
are trying to adhere pretty strictly to with each implementation:

- The script should print `hello, world` (lowercased, in the style of the above image),
  followed by a newline.
- Command line implementations only, unless explicitly impossible due to language
  constraints (such as HTML).
- Unless it is absolutely, 100% necessary, do not use third party libraries or
  packages. Try to use standard libraries whenever possible.
- All submissions should have an appropriate `Makefile` to build the source
  (where applicable).

### README Files

All submissions should have a README file that uses the following format:

```markdown
# Language-Name

An implementation of `hello, world` in the `Language-Name` programming language.

## Dependencies

- List of dependencies, if any

## Compilation

Compilation instructions using the `make` command or other build tools (where applicable)

## Usage

Usage instructions for running the script
